## Overview
The News-Scraper app is a simple application that searching the NY Times website for articles and reprints them. The user can look at articles as well as save them to future reading and has the ability to leave notes related to the article.
## How It Works
The user will start on the homepage. When they click the Scrape Button, the app will scrape NY Times page and show a list of articles. The user can save an article, which will stay on the saved page for future reading. The user can save notes and attach them to articles.
## Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Jquery, MongoDB, Axios, Cheerio, Express, Express-Handlebars, & Mongoose.
## Issues
Currently, the only issue is that the scraped articles are not presenting on the page. They do show up in the database on the Robo3t app, but do not show up on the page. I suspect its Handlebars related. Will updated if improvements are made.
## Role 
This is a solo project. As the only developer, I analyzed and interpreted the needs, wants, and requirements of the Product Owner (Trilogy) and created a functioning application from top to bottom that met those expectations.
